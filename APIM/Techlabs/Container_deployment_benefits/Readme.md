## Container deployment benefits

Purpose of this scenario is to show benefits of having the AMPLIFY API Management solution deployed as container. So this scenario is only relevant for container deployment. Let's prove the benefits of this type of deployment.

- [Elastic deployment](./Elastic_deployment): (optional) short explanation of how the solution is deployed within Kubernetes 

- [Preparation](./Preparation): preparation of your environment to play the demo. 

- [Auto-healing](./Auto-healing): let's stop brutaly API Manager and have container orchestration restoring the service

- [Elasticity](./Elasticity): let scale down the solution in a click. 

- [Auto-scaling](./Auto-scaling): let put the solution under some load, and watch more container orchestration providing more instances

- [Zero-downtime deployment](./ZDD):  still with traffic on-going, let's deploy a new configuration

- [Rollback](./Rollback): and finally, let's go back to initial status in a command line

**Next:** [Elastic deployment](./Elastic_deployment)
