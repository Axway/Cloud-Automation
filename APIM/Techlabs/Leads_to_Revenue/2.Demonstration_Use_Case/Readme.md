First, we will see how to connect to Slack, Salesforce and AMPLIFY platform.

Then we will create instances of the out of the box connectors on the platform to connect to the cloud applications (Slack and Salesforce).

After this, we will create a flow to send Salesforce information to Slack.

And we will create a new instance of the flow, to link connectors to  flow instances.

Finally, we will test the demonstration.
