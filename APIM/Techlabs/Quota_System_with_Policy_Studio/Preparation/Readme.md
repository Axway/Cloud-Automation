All you need to know about your environment is [here](../../Environment).

This scenario requires:
- API Management solution started (*if using Reference environement, hit "Start API Management" button to start APIM solution*).
- Policy Studio started (*if using Reference environement, hit "Policy Studio" icon on desktop to start it*).
- API Gateway Manager web UI opened (*default port 8090*).
- Policy Studio deployment URL.
- Default Service URL.
For last section
- API Manager UI URL (*default port 8075*).

Screenshorts are taken from the Reference Environment. On few features (Listener, deployment, ...) it can be different with other deployment. Do not worry, there will always be a **"Environment:"** note to help you.
