### Preparation

This scenario is meant to be played from your environment. Please connect to its Desktop (for example with RDP).

All you need to know about your environment is [here](../../Environment).

This scenario requires:
- API Management solution is started.
- Policy Studio is started. There is a button in the center of your desktop.
- API Gateway Manager web UI is opened. Use browser shortcut.
- Policy Studio deployment URL.
- Default Service URL.
For last section
- API Manager UI URL.
- API Manager Traffic URL.

Screenshorts are taken from the Reference Environment. On few features (Listener, deployment, ...) it can be different with other deployment. Do not worry, there will always be a **"Environment:"** note to help you.

**Next:** [Let's do our first throttling policy](../Throttling)
